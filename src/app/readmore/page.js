        OpenHands is not your typical crowdfunding site. It’s something simpler, deeper — and more human. We believe that help shouldn’t require red tape, polished campaigns, or perfect stories. Sometimes, people just need support. And sometimes, others just want to give.

        That’s where OpenHands comes in.

        Here, anyone can sign up and receive help — and anyone can give, with no strings attached. Whether it’s ₹100 or ₹10,000, it’s about kindness flowing directly between people, without limits or middlemen.

        There are no fundraising targets. No “campaign success rates.” No complicated reward tiers. Just real people, facing real-life needs, supported by the generosity of others.

        Whether you’re a student needing exam fees, a family facing unexpected expenses, or someone simply trying to stay afloat — OpenHands gives you a space to ask, to give, and to connect.

        Together, we’re building a community where compassion is currency, and support is always just one open hand away.
